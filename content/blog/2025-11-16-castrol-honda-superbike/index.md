title = "Why Castrol Honda Superbike crashes on (most) modern systems"
+++

A friend cleaned up and gave me a copy of a game I've not heard about before: _Castrol Honda
Superbike World Champions_, a motorbike racing game for PC, released 1998 by Interactive
Entertainment Ltd. and Midas Interactive Entertainment.

Given the age of the game (and looking at the system requirements) it's clear that the game comes
from the tricky era of early 3D-accelerated PC gaming. For context, my copy of the game helpfully
asks to install DirectX 5.

Before Windows was known for cramming AI and account requirements into every single corner of the
system, no matter how unnecessary, it was known for its excellent backwards compatibility with older
software. Generally, unless there are genuine bugs (and sometimes even despite them), Windows tries
its hardest to run old applications correctly.

Pushing my luck and trying to run it on my Windows 7 machine, however, resulted in either a getting
stuck on a black screen, or a crash, seemingly at random:

{{ image(src="./crash.webp", alt="Crash dialog from Windows 7: bike.exe has stopped working") }}

Let's go back in time and see how far we need to go to get it running: Installing and running it on
my Windows 98 and Windows XP machines was as uneventful, and the game works just fine[^1], including
with 3D acceleration. Glorious 1024x768x16:

## Debugging the issue

Debugging is more fun than playing, so let's get started! :^)

I pulled over the installation directory to my main machine and ran [Detect It
Easy](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy) to see what we can learn about the executable:

{{ image(src="./die.webp", alt="Screenshot of Detect It Easy with bike.exe loaded") }}

`Linker: Microsoft Linker(5.10)` and `Compiler: Microsoft Visual C/C++(...)[libcmtd]` are the
interesting bits here. Notice how it's `libcmtd`, not `libcmt`? The binary is linked against the
static _debug_ version of VC5's runtime. The debug runtime has heaps of extra checks and [logging],
which might help later.

[logging]:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/debugapi/nf-debugapi-outputdebugstringa

Let's attach a debugger and see what's going on. Given that the game crashes very early on (before
the credits intro screen), I hoped to see something right away. The cases where the game got stuck
in a loop seemed to actually get stuck in some Windows API call stack.

Anyway, the cases where it crashed gave a clearer starting point:

{{ image(src="./stack.webp", alt="Stack trace from debugger") }}

The game seems to be stuck after a call to DirectInput's `DirectInputCreateEx` function. At this
point I started to do some static analysis of the functions leading to this call. While doing that I
noticed that the game seems to have quite extensive logging, anything from game initialization to
memory allocations.

> If you're interested in all the logs, here are the config settings to enable them all:
>
> - In `Config.dat`, switch `ErrorLog`, `FileLog`, `MallocLog` from `off` to `on`.
>   - These are the "normal" log files the game produces.
>   - `ErrorLog` produces `error.log`, which is the general log file.
>   - `FileLog` produces `files.log`, tracking all opened files and their access modes.
>   - `MallocLog` produces `malloc.log`, tracking all memory allocations and frees. The devs even
>     kept descriptions for every allocation site!
> - Set an environment variable named `errorfile` to any file name (not path). The game will write
>   logs to that file in the game directory.
>   - You might also need to create an empty `*.c` file in the game directory.
>   - Just gives a bit of extra logging.
>
> Bonus: add a setting named `windowed=true` to the config file to force windowed mode; only works
> correctly in 16-bit mode (garbled graphics in True Color).

After enabling all the logging, I ran the game a few more times, and noticed that the last log
messages in `error.log` before the crash were these:

```
0> Instance : Mouse
0> Product : Mouse
1> Instance : Keyboard
1> Product : Keyboard
2> Instance : Gaming Mouse G502
2> Product : Gaming Mouse G502
3> Instance : Gaming Mouse G502
3> Product : Gaming Mouse G502
4> Instance : Gaming Mouse G502
4> Product : Gaming Mouse G502
5> Instance : Gaming Mouse G502
5> Product : Gaming Mouse G502
6> Instance : USB Keyboard
6> Product : USB Keyboard
7> Instance : USB Keyboard
7> Product : USB Keyboard
8> Instance : LED Controller
8> Product : LED Controller
```

Great, the game is enumerating input devices— uh, why is there an "LED Controller" device? The
motherboard in my Windows 7 machine has a built-in LED controller, so that checks out. Maybe the
detection isn't working properly, and the game is trying to use it as an input device?

After disabling the LED controller in Device Manager, the game started up just fine, consistently!
So far, so good. Of course I wanted to know what was actually going wrong, though, so let's see
where these messages are printed.

## Side quest: CD check

The game seemed to close without any notice if I forgot to insert the game disc. A quick trace
showed that the `GibbonPosture` setting in `f1.cfg` is used to point to the disc drive from which
the game was installed. The only check seems to be that the path `redist\dsetup.dll` exists on the
disc. Copying the redist folder to the installation directory and changing the setting to
`GibbonPosture=.\` seems to work just fine. :)

## The bug

Finding the `Instance :` and `Product :` log messages in the binary was easy enough. They are
referenced in only one function, which is a [`DIEnumDevicesCallback`] callback function that is
provided to `IDirectInput::EnumDevices` (Microsoft has only kept the documentation for the [DX8
version][enumdevices-dx8] of EnumDevices left online, but it's close enough).

[`DIEnumDevicesCallback`]:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ee416622(v=vs.85)
[enumdevices-dx8]:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ee417804(v=vs.85)

This is the pseudocode of the call and the callback, and the relevant data structure:

```c
struct DinputDeviceData
{
  char instance_name[128];
  char product_name[128];
  DWORD dwDevType;
  GUID guid;
};

// ...

BOOL __stdcall dinput_enumdevices_callback(LPCDIDEVICEINSTANCEA lpDevice, LPVOID pvRef)
{
    int index = g_dinput_device_index;
    g_direct_input_devices[index].guid = lpDevice->guidInstance;
    strcpy(g_direct_input_devices[index].instance_name, lpDevice->tszInstanceName);
    strcpy(g_direct_input_devices[index].product_name, lpDevice->tszProductName);
    g_direct_input_devices[index].dwDevType = lpDevice->dwDevType;

    log_line("%d> Instance : %s\n", index, lpDevice->tszInstanceName);
    log_line("%d> Product : %s\n", index, lpDevice->tszProductName);

    if ( LOBYTE(g_direct_input_devices[index].dwDevType) == DIDEVTYPE_JOYSTICK )
    {
        int joystick_index = g_joystick_index;
        g_joystick_info[joystick_index].dinput_device_index = index;
        g_joystick_info[joystick_index].field_4 = 0;
        g_joystick_info[joystick_index].field_8 = 0;
        g_joystick_info[joystick_index].field_38 = 0;
        g_joystick_info[joystick_index].field_1 = 0;
        g_joystick_index = joystick_index + 1;
    }
    g_dinput_device_index = index + 1;

    return DIENUM_CONTINUE;
}

// ...

g_dinput_create_hresult = DirectInputCreateA(hInstance, 0x500u, &g_dinput_instance, 0);
g_dinput_device_index = 0;
g_joystick_index = 0;
g_dinput_instance->lpVtbl->EnumDevices(
    g_dinput_instance, 0, dinput_enumdevices_callback, 0, DIEDFL_ATTACHEDONLY);
```

So, for each enumerated device, the game stores some general information about it in the global
array `g_direct_input_devices`. Then, if the device is a joystick (generally, a game controller), it
also adds it to `g_joystick_info`.

Can you guess the bug yet? :) If not, here's the declaration of the global arrays:

```c
DinputDeviceData g_direct_input_devices[8];
// ...
JoystickInfo g_joystick_info[8];
```

There's only space for eight DirectInput devices in the array! `8> Instance : LED Controller` was
the ninth one, overwriting lots of important other data in the process, including timer handles and
the actual DirectInput instance pointer.

But it gets worse: The game uses DirectInput for game controllers only. Copying the device info out
of `lpDevice` is entirely pointless for other types of devices. Just moving the `DIDEVTYPE_JOYSTICK`
check up would have hidden the bug for basically all setups, since you'd have to have more than 8
game controllers connected for the game to write out of bounds.

Actually, there would've been an even simpler workaround: `EnumDevices` allows passing a `DIDEVTYPE`
as a filter:

```c
g_dinput_instance->lpVtbl->EnumDevices(
    g_dinput_instance, DIDEVTYPE_JOYSTICK, dinput_enumdevices_callback, 0, DIEDFL_ATTACHEDONLY);
                    // ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

This would make DirectInput call the callback for game controllers only. Without it, all devices,
whether they are keyboards, mice, or actually any HID devices, are enumerated. (I've checked the
DirectX 5 SDK docs, and even there it mentions the HID device support.) This includes the
vendor-defined devices of my mouse and its emulated keyboard (for macros), and of course the
motherboard's LED controller.

The moral of the story? Always check your bounds, kids! You'll never know if some weirdo comes along
and plugs in a dozen game controllers to their PC. :\^)

## The fix

[Over on GitHub] I've pushed a minimal patch as a classic DLL shim. With the provided `dinput.dll`
in the game directory, the game will load that instead of the system one. DirectInput has only one
relevant exported function that we need to shim: `DirectInputCreateA`. The rest of the API is
implemented via COM interfaces, for which we can modify the respective vtables as needed.

[Over on GitHub]: https://github.com/seritools/castrol-honda-dinput-fix

I've implemented two fixes in the shim:

1. Inject the `DIDEVTYPE_JOYSTICK` filter in the call to `EnumDevices` to only return joysticks/game
   controllers.
2. Cancel enumeration once 8 joysticks have been found.

For fun, I've also tried to minimize the size of the shim DLL -- the final binary weighs in at 2
KiB.

Furthermore, I switched to `rust-lld.exe` as the linker, as it's fine with setting
`/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS,4.0"` and `/OSVERSION:4.0` without complaining. :) Since there is no linked
runtime code at all, the resulting binary should work on any 32-bit Windows version, even without
[Rust9x]. I've tested it on Windows 7 and Windows 98 SE.

      system, graphics card, or game version? Investigating that is left as a mystery for another
      day.
