title = "How IDA 7.2's installer password was found"
+++

In January 2019, the installer files for IDA 7.2 were leaked. This does not mean it was usable however, as you need an installer password to install and a licence file to activate it.
Separately to that, a license file from ESET was leaked, which didn't match the feature set of the installer file.

But all the leaks didn't matter, because without the installer password, the program files were safe. Until now. :)

On 2019-06-21, devcore published a [blog post](https://devco.re/blog/2019/06/21/operation-crack-hacking-IDA-Pro-installer-PRNG-from-an-unusual-way-en/) about obvious flaws in the MacOS and Linux installers for IDA, including the password as plaintext in the setup file. The Windows installer, however, uses [InnoSetup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) as installation engine.

InnoSetup encrypts the program data with the installer password and hashes it via SHA-1, prepending it with `PasswordCheckHash` and eight random bytes as salt. The password being 12 alphanumeric characters long means that bruteforcing it is pretty much out of the question.

Unless you find out how the passwords were generated in the first place! Devcore found out that the passwords are simply generated with a small Perl script using `srand()`/`rand()`. This only works for versions up to 6.8 though, and not even all installers, as *qudiss* noted:

> I noticed [Perl 5.20.0's PRNG implementation](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Random_number_generator_(included)#Perl) can't be used to find seeds for the other leaked passwords (e.g. `ZFdLqEM2QMVe`) or to bruteforce IDA 7.0-7.2 setup passwords. I assume different algorithms/charsets/etc. were used for these?

I found that interesting and verified their findings by converting the code to Rust and do a full search for all PRNG seeds (assuming 32-bit). To do that I've dug through the Perl source code to find the exact [implementation of DRand48](https://github.com/Perl/perl5/blob/df09255f565b73f060cd59e80498786e0f80d4a7/util.c#L5817). This, converted to Rust, amounts to something like:

```rust
use float_extras::f64::ldexp;

pub struct DRand48 {
    pub x: u64
}

impl DRand48 {
    #[inline]
    pub fn next_f64(&mut self) -> f64 {
        self.x = self.x.wrapping_mul(0x5DEE_CE66D).wrapping_add(0xB) & 0xFFFF_FFFF_FFFF;
        ldexp(self.x as f64, -48)
    }

    #[inline]
    pub fn set_seed(&mut self, seed: u32) {
        self.x = 0x330Eu64 + (u64::from(seed) << 16);
    }
}
```

The rest is just a big loop over the full 32-bit range, setting the initial seed, generating the password, hashing it according to InnoSetup's scheme, and comparing that with the saved hash in the installer. Using [Rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) I've quickly converted it to multithreaded computation, yielding an >8x speed improvement on my system.

... and yes, the 7.0 hash for example is never found. The other 6.8 passwords are not found either. So, what now?

## Breaking open the 7.0 installer

I guess I was pretty lucky, since my first idea was actually correct. qudiss' comment above included a very helpful link and hint: The PRNG implementation used in Perl and here was first introduced in Perl 5.20. So I've looked into what Perl used before DRand48 was added, thinking the passwords could have just be generated with an even older version.

And [here](https://github.com/Perl/perl5/blob/05ccd577e15cc66bbb7414fad5ee3c02f536c7a5/uconfig.h#L3096) it is:

```c
#define Drand01()       ((rand() & 0x7FFF) / (double) ((unsigned long)1 << 15))     /**/
#define Rand_seed_t     int    /**/
#define seedDrand01(x)  srand((Rand_seed_t)x)   /**/
```

Just a simple C call to `srand` and `rand`, converting the random number to a double with a bit of bit-fiddling.

Rechecking the full range was a little bit uglier with the older PRNG code, since C's `srand`/`rand` are not thread-safe, since it uses global state. That meant instead of using rayon multithreading, the brute-force loop has to run single-threaded. To make the check not lose all of its previous speed, I've batched the search space into 16 blocks and just ran the tool 16 times in parallel.

```rs
use hex_literal::hex;
use libc::{rand, srand};
use sha1::{Digest, Sha1};
use std::{env, f64};

const CHARS: &[u8; 54] = b"abcdefghijkmpqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHJKLMPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789";

const HASH: [u8; 20] = hex!("0000000000000000000000000000000000000000");
const PEPPER: &[u8; 17] = b"PasswordCheckHash";
const SALT: [u8; 8] = hex!("0000000000000000");

fn main() {
    let block_str = env::args().nth(1).expect("block");
    let block = block_str.parse::<u32>().expect("block");
    assert!(block < 16);

    let sha1template = {
        let mut hasher = Sha1::new();
        hasher.input(PEPPER);
        hasher.input(SALT);
        hasher
    };

    let start = block << 28;
    let length = 0x0FFF_FFFFu32;

    let mut buf = [0u8; 12];

    for i in start..=(start + length) {
        perl_srand(i);

        for n in &mut buf {
            *n = CHARS[perl_rand(54) as usize];
        }

        let mut hasher = sha1template.clone();
        hasher.input(&buf);

        let hash = hasher.result();

        if hash[..] == HASH {
            println!("FOUND: {}", i);
            return;
        }
    }

    println!("not found");
}

#[inline]
fn perl_srand(seed: u32) {
    unsafe { srand(seed) }
}

#[inline]
fn perl_rand(max: u32) -> u32 {
    (f64::from(unsafe { rand() } & 0x7FFF) / ((1u64 << 15) as f64) * f64::from(max)) as u32
}
```

This, surprisingly, turned out to be the right idea and successfully bruteforces the other hashes/passwords.

## IDA 7.2, though
